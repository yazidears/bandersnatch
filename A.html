            <h1>Ask Alice</h1>
            <p>You sit down with Alice, trying to understand her situation. Her eyes are filled with fear and sadness. After a few moments of silence, she starts to open up about her father. "He's not the same person he used to be," she says, her voice trembling. "He... he hurts me, and he's always taking these strange pills."</p>
