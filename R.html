    <h1>Confront with Gun</h1>
    <p>With the gun in your hand, you confront the father. He tries to attack you, but you manage to evade him. "Stop!" you yell, pointing the gun at him. He sneers at you, mocking your attempts to stand up to him. In the heat of the moment, you fire the gun. The father falls, and Alice looks at you with a mixture of fear and relief.</p>
